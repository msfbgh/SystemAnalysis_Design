DriverPass, a driver education company is looking to help drivers pass the driving test because there are very few driver educational tools on the market. DriverPass allows student drivers to learn online about driving laws and regulations, take practice diving exams, watch videos that will help them prepare for the on the road driving test.  The purpose of the project is to provide an interactive learning experience for the students and build a system that allows students to make a reservation online to schedule a driving lesson. The online virtual component provides the students the ability to learn online and take practice driving exams and also allows students and employees of DriverPass to sign students up for lessons by making appointments online.

Once the DriverPass system is completed student drivers will be able to learn online about driving laws and regulations, take practice diving exams, watch videos that will help them prepare for the on the road driving test. Student’s should be able to view their progress when they log into their personal account. Students will also be provided with notes and advice from their diving instructors. Students will also be able to login to their accounts and customize their program by modifying their packages by adding lessons, removing lessons based on their training needs. Employees of DriverPass will be able to view student progress reports and make appointments for students to take driving lessons. 
Instructors and other administrative staff of DriverPass will be able to grade student tests and provide notes, advice and guidance that the students can later view. Administrative and security staff of DriverPass should have the ability to add and remove student access to the student’s  DriverPass learning accounts.

I think I did well capturing the client's requirements in the Business Requirements Document. I think I also did well creating the System Design Document. I would revise the sequence diagram. Making the sequence diagram was a challenge for me. I read and reviewed the DriverPass Interview Transcript to make sure
